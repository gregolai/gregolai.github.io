I work with designers on a daily basis to implement UI specs for React components that are used across teams. Much of this work has enlightened me to the challenges of building a shared component library versus building a front-facing application. Having a consistent and thought-out API is crucial for any shared library. Unlike refactoring a front-facing application, refactoring a library without introducing breaking changes is often non-trivial if the consumer API requires a change. On top of that, there are trade-offs with how much flexibility to expose to the consumer versus the likelihood of breaking changes.</li><li>The designs are implemented across desktop, mobile-web, iOS, and Android platforms. Our components make heavy use of React and React-Native.</li><li>We use Jest, Enzyme, Puppeteer, and Cypress for unit and integration testing.</li></ul></div><div><div class="job-top"><span class="job-where">Agorafy</span><span class="job-role">Front-End Web Developer</span></div><span class="job-dates">December 2016 - May 2017</span><ul><li>I worked as a frontend engineer to build a CMS for creating and editing real estate listings.
